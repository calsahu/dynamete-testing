'''
This file defines three functions that get the needed means for lambda dynamics,
get the needed matrix and vector for inversion, and define the necessary iteration scheme.
This version uses the flexible definitions for cov and mean, not the hard coded ones. This will
make it much slower, but it also means that we can change f,h,q much easier.
This file uses the toy model with only n and no e dependence.

    '''
    Iterates the lambda dynamics theory. This works by updating lambdas from the derivatives obtained from the
    covariance matrix calculated in get_dl_matrix_vector. The scheme is:
    1. Get derivatives of lambdas
    2. Update state variables s_t+1 = s_t + ds_t
    3. Update derivatives with new state variables, ie. dN/dt = S <f(X_t+1,lambda_t)>
    4. Update lambdas as l_t+1 = l_t + dt dl/dt
    
    THIS DEFINITION PART IS INCORRECT
    The first step is slightly different. We can either pass in only the state variables and parameters,
    in which case the theory assumes that we start in METE and calculates the corresponding lambdas and derivatives,
    or we can pass in lambdas and derivatives explicitly to iterate from anywhere.
    The former is basically the perturbation way, and the latter is a generic iteration.
    
    Inputs
    t is the number of iteration steps to take
    s are state variables, call S, N
    p are parameters, call b0, d0, Nc
    Optional:
    l are lambdas as an array, so l[0] is lambda_1 etc.
    ds are derivatives of state variables, call dN
    dt is the length of the time step, 0.2 by default.
    Outputs:
    lambdas, state variables, and their derivatives at each time t. 
    The arrays are length t+1 since it prints the initial values.
