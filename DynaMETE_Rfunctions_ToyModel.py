'''
This file defines all of the necessary functions for DynaMETE, including the transition functions and
the structure function R. This function does NOT include sums over n, since it is designed to be a 
more flexible version incorporating different transition functions. This will be very slow for large N or E.
It also defines the METE constraint for beta, which is needed, and a function to obtain mete_lambdas.
This file uses the toy model with only n and no e dependence.
